Overview
========

Ikimono means "living thing".  Use this project to make your things into living things, using NFC, and some clever 3D on your Android.  The ultimate goal is that creatives, individuals, and non-developers could have a toolkit that allows one to annotate the real world, and give each object a corresponding virtual presence.  It's possible down the road to create virtual environments that allow interfaction of things, for education, gaming, entertainment, or social purposes.  The real value may be in Education, though the initial focus is on purely entertainment purposes.
